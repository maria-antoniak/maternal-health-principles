# Designing Guiding Principles for NLP for Healthcare: A Case Study of Maternal Health

<br><br>

## Overview

This repository contains the survey responses for our study on NLP for healthcare.

We include responses for three cohorts: birthing people (recruited via Prolific), healthcare workers (recruited via Prolific), and workshop participants (opted into a workshop on "maternal health equity").

All participants consented to participation in this research study and to having their responses recorded and shared publicly. Our study was approved by the IRB and the Allen Institute for AI.

## Data Description

The data files include:
- `survey_results_bp_PUBLIC.csv` The responses from 30 birthing people.
- `survey_results_hcw_PUBLIC.csv` The responses from 30 healthcare workers.
- `survey_results_wp_PUBLIC.csv` The responses from 39 workshop participants.

Because the workshop participants interacted with one another during a live session and could potentially identify each other's responses, we omit their demographic information from this public repository.
